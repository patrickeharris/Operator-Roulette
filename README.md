# Operator-Roulette
Randomly pick operators for a team on Rainbow Six: Siege.
Simply enter the number of players, name each player, and state whether you are on attack or defense. The program will give each player a random operator and when any key is pressed each player will receive a new operator on the opposing side (attack or defense).
